stepToMM 0.471239

dm1 = 1.07031	 
dm2 = 161.782

Calculate how many steps each motor must do:

Msteps = dm1 / stepsToMM
 
m1Steps = 2,2;
m2Steps = 343;

Now find the delay for each motor

we calculate the speed for the longest distance depending on our preset maximum speed
so : 
Total Time = length / speed 
tm1 = 161 / 33  = 4.87 seconds

now we know that we have to do 343 steps in 4.87 seconds so we can calculate the right delay 

delay = time / steps 
delay = (4.87 * 1000) / 343  ==  14.198 delayMS


for the other motor = 
delay = (4.87 * 1000) / 2.2  == 2213 delayMS



Break big lines to smaller ones

if dm1 = 160 
we say that maximum one segment length is 30 for example
then lines = 160/30 = 5,3
then we have a loop 5 times per 30mm 
between each look we do  the FK and recompute the distance and delays. 
and final segment is the remaining 30 * 0.3 = 9 mm 



Break big lines to smaller ones V2

When we get a long line first calculate its length. If the length is bigger than the desired maximum segment length we divide it with the segment length and we also keep the remainder. Then to draw the line we find the current string lengths depending on our current position and we use
